# 0xProto-Custom

`0xProto-Custom` is a derivative of the `0xProto` font, which was originally created by the [0xType Project Authors](https://github.com/0xType). This custom version introduces modifications to the original font structure and build process while adhering to the SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1.
This repository represents the font that has been customized and slimmed down for my own needs.

## Changes in `0xProto-Custom`
The following notable modifications have been made to the original `0xProto` project:
- **Font Files Removed**: All `.woff2` files from the `fonts` directory have been removed.
- **Makefile Updated**: The `Makefile` has been modified to reflect customizations and edits to the font workflow.
